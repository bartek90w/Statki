Student project, game "The Battleship"

I made this project to pass subject "Programming in C++". I know that this code isn't perfect, but I learned a lot of thanks to that. It is my first bigger project, where I used object programming. 
This is a known game "The Battleship". You can choose 2 difficulty level. You win, when you shoot all the computer's ships.
